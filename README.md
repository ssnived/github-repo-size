## Private Repository

To enable viewing size of private repositories;

1. Install extension from chrome webstore, if you haven't.
2. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens to generate your personal access token.

- Check `repo` scope to enable this extension on private repo.

3. Click on the Github Repo Size extension (this extension)'s icon aside the address bar.
4. Paste your access token there in the prompt box.

### Temporarily override the token

You can set `x-github-token` in `localStorage` to your access token, and the extension will use this value even if you've previously set token.

    localStorage.setItem('x-github-token', <YOUR-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN>)

and then remove it to use previously set token;

    localStorage.removeItem('x-github-token')

## Development

1. Clone this repo
2. Go to chrome extensions [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable developer mode
4. Click on load unpacked extension and select this cloned repo

## Playwright Tests

- Playwright tests are provided in the `/tests` folder
- Traces are on by default so you will have access to the playwright traceviewer to debug any failed tests

### Running Playwright Tests

- Use `npm run playwright:test` to run the tests automatically

### Debugging Playwright Tests

- Use `npm run playwright:test:debug` to run the tests in debug mode

### .env

- You will need a `.env` file to run the tests, I have provided a sample in the `.env.template` file
- Please note this is a sample, in the real version please do not include any RHS values in the .env.template file

### options.ts

- This file is for all of your reusable test data, this is essentially your centralised location where all of your tests can reference this from.

### fixtures

- The `fixtures.ts` file allows for specific playwright browser contexts to be initialised, namely the ones for extension enabled and disabled.

### Tests

1. `repoSizeExtensionDisabled.spec` - tests the when the extension is disabled
2. `repoSizeExtensionEnabled.spec` - tests when the extension is enabled

- Note that the `test.describe("Extension Enabled: File Size Validation"` test suite will fail unless you know the exact file names and corresponding sizes and you have put that in the testDataFile. I have provided a sample of what that looks like in the `options.ts` file
